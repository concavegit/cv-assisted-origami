# Background and Context
Currently, we are at a stage where the MVP we have in mind is close to being done. What this entails is a GUI to select
a desired origami piece to fold and the option to push a key to go to the next step in the fold. There are two options for the
way you want to fold. One is to have the picture of the instructions overlayed in the upper left corner, or to have the lines 
projected onto the piece of paper itself. In both cases the instructions will be read to you by the computer.

In terms of our architecture, our current layout (in a basic sense) is a class to detect the paper and a class to overlay the
instructions onto the paper/put the picture in the corner.

# Key Questions
* As a user, are you satisfied with this product? If not, what are we missing?
* Is there any area of the MVP you would like to see beefed up a bit?
* How should we position the computer, paper, and camera relative to each other
