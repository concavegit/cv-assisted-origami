# Feedback and Desicions

For the instructions overlayed in the upper left hand corner, we should include the previous step as well to reduce the amount
of flipping back and forth. We also recieved feedback that this piece of the project didn't seem particularly useful, but we think we are going to leave the option in the GUI because it is something that we did. Sid recieved the feedback that he should use color in his projections of origami instructions, but
he tried to implement this idea, and it degraded the quality of the code's output. A lot of people said that they would prefer
the paper to be either in front of the computer or to the side of the computer. As a default, we think that it should be positioned
in front of the computer, but it should be pretty easy for the user to move around to their liking.

# Review Process Reflection
I think that the review went fairly well. I don't think that we gained all that much because we were planning for most of the
feedback to come from a demo (of which only part of our code worked for because of a change of environment and OpenCV being
glitchy). We provided our audience with a good amount of context for our project. We showed them a simple UML diagram and some quick demos.
We stuck fairly close to our initial agenda, although we expected more questions then we got, so we had a few minutes left over.
