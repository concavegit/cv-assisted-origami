# Arcitectural Review 1 Reflection

1. Feedback and Desicions
We gained feedback that made is aware that keeping track of the exact state of the paper may be overcomplicated and unnecisary
recognizing whether the paper is in the right position. For our MVP, we decided to now assume that the user is always making
the move, and give them the option to flip back in the instruction in case they messed up. In terms of keeping track/tracking
the paper itself, we will try and implement the feedback of putting a pattern on the paper or some kind of indicators of which
side of the paper should be the open side, etc.

2. Review Process Reflection
Overall, the review went really well, and we got good suggestions for all of the key questions we asked. Something we are
particularly glad we did, was that we asked for clarification questions before we dove into our key questions. Not everyone is
familiar with the tools of OpenCV, and I think we were able to clear up some misconceptions/fill gaps in knowlege that enabled
everyone to give proper feedback. We did stick close to our planned agenda with the exception of asking for clarification questions
before we went into our key questions. To have a more effective technical review, next time we could show progress in some way, whether
it's a live demo, someone tries, our program, or we show a video. This can, in a way, act as a play test and provide us real user
feedback.
