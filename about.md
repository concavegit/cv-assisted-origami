We are a group of engineers who have come close to failure many times and have had to perservere through many failed origami models.
With this project, we hope to erase this pain for future folders and make origami more enjoyable.

We all enjoy origami a lot.
However, as students, everything is better where learning is involved!
Each member of the team entered with a learning goal in mind.

## Kawin Nikomborirak
Kawin has a fair amount of experience with creating 'academic' code.
However, he knows that the world needs products which solve problems and can be used by everyone.
In that regard he has been excited to go through the process of making something useable and intuitive.
He also is intrigued by computer vision and its computational and yet non-deterministic qualities, and has been happy to use this project as an excuse to explore the field.

# Credit
Other than those nerds described up there, there are groups and individuals who have been critical to actualizing our dreams.

### Ben Hill
Ben Hill is our software design instructor and has put up with our out-of-control imagination and ambition and always pointed us in a constructive direction.

### All [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) Developers
OpenCV was the image processing tool we used.
The amount of work, talent, and knowlege is phenomenal, and we are glad that intellligent people with PHDs put this together for idiots like us to use for free.

### The [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) Company
Having a graphical user interface which works across windows, mac, and linux seamlessly is a blessing.
The existance of QT has certainly saved a lot of our hair from being pulled out.
