We are a group of engineers who have come close to failure many times and have had to perservere through many failed origami models.
With this project, we hope to make this pain for future folders and make origami more enjoyable.

We all enjoy origami a lot.
However, as students, everything is better where learning is involved!
Each member of the team entered with a learning goal in mind.

## Kawin Nikomborirak
Kawin has a fair amount of experience with creating 'academic' code.
However, he knows that the world needs products which solve problems and can be used by everyone.
In that regard he has been excited to go through the process of making something useable and intuitive.
He also is intrigued by computer vision and its computational and yet non-deterministic qualities, and was happy to use this project as an excuse to explore the field.
