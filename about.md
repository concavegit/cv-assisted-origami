We are a group of engineers who have come close to failure many times and have had to perservere through many failed origami models.
With this project, we hope to erase this pain for future folders and make origami more enjoyable.

We all enjoy origami a lot.
However, as students, everything is better where learning is involved!
Each member of the team entered with a learning goal in mind.

## Kawin Nikomborirak
Kawin has a fair amount of experience with creating 'academic' code.
However, he knows that the world needs products which solve problems and can be used by everyone.
In that regard he has been excited to go through the process of making something useable and intuitive.
He also is intrigued by computer vision and its computational and yet non-deterministic qualities, and has been happy to use this project as an excuse to explore the field.

## Mark Goldwater
Mark has a fair amount of programming experience programming, but started seriously writing functional and
useful programs his first year at Olin College. He has been interested in OpenCV and what is has to offer, so he
has been happy to engage in a project that utilized the library and apply it to another one of his interests: origami.

## Sid Garimella
Sid also has a fair amount of programming, but has taken a liking to the mathematics involved in computer vision. Having researched similar topics prior to joining Olin, the problem of origami state detection appealed greatly to him, and he gladly took on the project. 

# Process
Our group began with two interests: machine learning and computer vision.
However, as the intersection between the two is either already done or the subject of PhD research, we began to ask what we enjoyed: origami.


From that point, we wanted to make instructions easier to follow using computer vision. Traditional origami books are often difficult to interpret/understand, so we wanted our program to make
doing origami easier and more accessible especially to the beginner. We spent around a week fleshing out this idea, after which we learned a few things from our peers.
One thing we learned was that we were getting hung up on some way to describe the state of an origami model to use in our program, when really all we needed was a picture of an outline of the desired outcome and a few lines to indicate folds.

We spent another week creating our minimum viable product (MVP) and once again turned to our peers for advice.
We were then reminded that much of origami is comparing the current step to the next step, and so as a future development we can put a picture of the next instruction in a corner for comparison. These were good ideas, and may implement them in the future.

# Credit
Other than those nerds described up there, there are groups and individuals who have been critical to actualizing our dreams.

### Our Peers
No product is complete without feedback, and software is incomplete without technical feedback.
Everyone in our software design studio who went through the trouble of listening to us ramble about our goal and giving us feedback deserves a hand.

### Ben Hill
Ben Hill is our software design instructor and has put up with our out-of-control imagination and ambition and always pointed us in a constructive direction.

### All [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) Developers
OpenCV was the image processing tool we used.
The amount of work, talent, and knowlege is phenomenal, and we are glad that intellligent people with PhDs put this together for idiots like us to use for free.

### The [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) Company
Having a graphical user interface which works across windows, mac, and linux seamlessly is a blessing.
The existance of QT has certainly saved a lot of our hair from being pulled out.
